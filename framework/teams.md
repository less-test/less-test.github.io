A Team in LeSS is the same as a Team in one-team Scrum. The goal of the team in LeSS is to add a couple of Product Backlog Items into the Product during the Sprint. They work closely with customers/users on clarifying the definition of the items and with the Product Owner on the prioritization. They [coordinate and integrate](coordination-and-integration.html) their work with other teams so that at the end of the Sprint they will together have produced [one whole product increment](../principles/whole-product-focus.html) .

## Well-structured Teams

In LeSS each team:

* is [self-managing](../management/self_managing_teams.html)
* is cross-functional --- all skills required are inside the team or the team can acquire them
* shares responsibility for all the teamâ€™s work
* has a shared team goal
* has responsibility for managing its own relationships with external teams and people
