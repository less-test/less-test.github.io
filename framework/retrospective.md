At the end of the Sprint, all the teams have their individual Retrospectives. This is the same as a one-team Scrum retrospective.

During each of the individual team Retrospectives, they should also brainstorm about larger obstacles that are impeding them and all the other teams and put them on the [organizational improvement backlog](../management/improvement_service.html)
