Conceptually there is one product-level Sprint leading to one integrated [Potentially Shippable Product Increment](potentially-shippable-product-increment.html).

This practically means:

* [Sprint Planning](sprint-planning-one.html) for all teams is at the same time.
* [Sprint Review](sprint-review.html) and [Sprint Retrospective](retrospective.html) is at the same time.
* The team-level [Product Backlog Refinement](product-backlog-refinement.html) doesn't need to be at the same time!
